# Shark and Fish Game

This is a simple game where a shark eats fish to score points. The shark can move around the screen and eat fish that appear. Each time the shark eats a fish, the score increases. The game ends once the score reaches 10.

### Game Description:
- The shark moves using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- When the shark touches a fish, the fish disappears, and the score increases by 1.
- The game ends once you reach a score of 10. When this happens, the game will stop, and a "Game Over" message will appear.

### Controls:
- *Up Arrow*: Move the shark up.
- *Down Arrow*: Move the shark down.
- *Left Arrow*: Turn the shark to the left.
- *Right Arrow*: Turn the shark to the right.

### How to Play:
- Your goal is to eat as many fish as possible to increase your score.
- Each fish you eat adds 1 point to your score.
- The game ends when you score 10 points.
- After reaching 10 points, the game will display a "Game Over" message.

### Future Updates:
- *Multiple Levels*: The next update will introduce multiple levels, where the game gets progressively harder.
- *Better Graphics and Sounds*: I will work on enhancing the visuals and adding sound effects for a better gaming experience.

### How to Play the Game:
You can play the game by downloading the .sb3 file from this repository and opening it in Scratch.
